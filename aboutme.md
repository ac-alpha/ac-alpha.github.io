Hi! I am Ashutosh Chaubey, a senior undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I am born and brought up at Bhilai, Chhattisgarh, India. Having a keen interest in Computer Science since my secondary school (I had opted for Computer Science in my secondary school), I decided to join the same branch at IIT Roorkee based on my JEE (Advance) Rank. Since then, I have been fortunate to learn and be a part of numerous projects related to Computer Science. My specific areas of interest include Deep Learning and Machine Learning. I have a keen interest in problem-solving and have worked on some fascinating and challenging modern world problems in the internships that I have done. I see deep learning as an efficient and effective tool to solve complex and challenging tasks, which is also evident from its ability to solve tasks as complex as facial detection and verification to human pose prediction.

I am proficient in core computer science fields, such as Operating Systems, Computer Networks and Database Management Systems, which is evident from my excellent academic track record. Apart from having theoretical knowledge of these fields, I have worked on a couple of projects related to these fields. I possess outstanding managerial skills and fluent in speaking and writing both English and Hindi. Currently, I am the head of two technical groups within the IIT Roorkee Campus, IIT Roorkee ACM Student Chapter, and Vision and Language Group. 

To sum it all up, I am a seasoned deep learning enthusiast, having a keen interest in solving exciting and challenging modern-day problems, with the desire to learn and grow in a fast-paced environment.
