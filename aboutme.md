My name is Ashutosh Chaubey and I am a Data Science Enthusiast, Android Developer and Web Developer, currently living in Roorkee, India. I am currently in the second year of my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering which I am pursuing from Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. Interest in the field of computer science right from the secondary school level motivated me to choose it as my specialisation. In my free time, I watch random stuff on youtube. I am both driven and self-motivated, and I am constantly experimenting with new technologies and techniques. I am very passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and strive to better myself as a developer, and the development community as a whole.

I have been studying about Machine Learning and Deep Learning since my third semester in college. I have done the deeplearning.ai specialization available on [Coursera]("https://coursera.org/").

I am an experienced android developer having sound knowledge of both front-end and back-end. I am an experienced user of Databases and Object Oriented Programming. I am quite comfortable with using web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, Bootstrap,etc. at the frontend as well as Django(REST Framework) at the backend. Deep Learning is currently my area of exploration and studying. I have sound knowledge and hands on experience of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I am also proficient in many non-android-based languages, including but not limited to C, C++, Python, VHDL and MIPS Assembly Language.
