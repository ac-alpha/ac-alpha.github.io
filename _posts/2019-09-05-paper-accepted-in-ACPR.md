Our paper `"A Generative Adversarial Network based Ensemble Technique for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Synthesized Speech"` has been accepted for poster presentation in the 5th Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR 2019) to be held between 26-29th November 2019 in Auckland, NZ. I congratulate my co-authors Jaynil Jaiswal, B. Sasikiran Reddy and Shashank Kashyap for all their valuable support for making this happen. I thank our mentor Puneet who has helped us through out this project and giving important tips on how to write and organise a paper. I also thank our professors Dr. R. Balasubramanian and Dr. Partha P. Roy to give us this opportunity to showcase our work on a global platform. 

I will soon add a full post covering a summary of our work and how we ended up successfully submitting it to a conference. I will also include a camera-ready version of our work in the same post.
